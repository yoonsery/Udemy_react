## React

React is all about `Components`

component is combination of html code

### Why Components?

1. Reusability

   - Do not repeat yourself

2. Separation of concerns

   - Do not too many things in one and the same place
   - 코드를 작고 관리할 수 있는 규모로 유지할 수 있다

=> Split big chunk of code into multiple smaller functions

### React & Components

React allows you to create re-usable & reactive components consisting of HTML and javaScript(and CSS)  
⬇️  
Declarative Approach  
⬇️  
Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual javaScript DOM instructions

## Props

Components can not just use data stored in other components  
You can pass data to custom component by adding an attribute. Inside of that component you can acess to all these attributes
